Small coding snippet projects I have written

Here we have a few small coding snippets I have written for various projects

There are a few files referenced in some of the code snippets. I have detailed those dependencies below:

-anomaly.py uses the plaintext file mammal_sleep_1.txt

-maxAge.py uses the plaintext file names.txt

-pandas_mcrofts_a2.py uses the CSV file a2_data.csv
